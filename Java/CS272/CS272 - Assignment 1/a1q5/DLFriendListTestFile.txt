Note: I used a friend list of size 5 rather than 10 for testing.

Enter <first name> <last name>: John Smith
Enter <first name> <last name>: Daniel Wes
Enter <first name> <last name>: Joyce Zhang
Enter <first name> <last name>: Adam Xue
Enter <first name> <last name>: Wallace Bee


Original Friend List:
Smith, John
Wes, Daniel
Zhang, Joyce
Xue, Adam
Bee, Wallace

Sorted Friend List:
Bee, Wallace
Smith, John
Wes, Daniel
Xue, Adam
Zhang, Joyce

Find friend in the list by first name:
John is in the list: true
Daniel is in the list: true
Joyce is in the list: true
Adam is in the list: true
Wallace is in the list: true
Joe is in the list: false
